# AALE Frameworks

## Industry Classifications on Autonomous Systems

As we look toward Automated Autonomous Legal Entities-

It will become critical to establish Frameworks for thinking about this
new domain..... that is Frameworks
for degrees of automated and autonomous legal things.

Borrowing from the Auto Industry and Joi Ito (Director Of the MIT Media Lab),

It is helpful to think of levels of
Automated Autonomous Legal Entities.

The Auto industry uses  5 Levels Of Autonomous vehicles:
Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS)
Don’t read the article, just look at that chart at the top-

As Computational Law develops across Statutes and Token/SmartContract Designs- it will be useful to ascribe Levels of various metrics to these systems.


## Maher’s Suggested Metrics and Ranges
{This is the simplistic Way I can think of for these diverse attributes}

A range is useful-   1,2,3,4,5

3 is halfway

Non/No        -   Fully/All
  1                  -   5


Obvious metrics are:
         1                       -           5
Non automated       - fully automated
Non autonomous    - fully autonomous
No Safety.                - fully safe
No human-in-loop  - human-in-loop
Paper contract        - full auto-contract
Not Decentralized   - fully Decentralized
anonymous ID          - fully known ID
Manual corporate Registration -
      fully automated corporate Registration

Not Directly Owned - Directly Owned


There could be other metrics with a range of degrees:
security, utility etc.....

autonomous systems in general}

Remember in terms of AI and Safety and they’re manifestation with Blockchains, SmartContracts and Legislation- is coming upon us fast....

It will be critical to have some rational ways of thinking about these things.
